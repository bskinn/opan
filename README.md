# opan (OpenAnharmonic)


Dreams one day to be an automated system for driving VPT2 anharmonic
 (and possibly other) computations on a variety of computational/quantum chemistry software
 packages.
 
Starting with v0.4, this project strives to follow [Semantic Versioning v2.0.0](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)
  and [PEP 440](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440), with PEP 440 taking priority.  Thus, some elements of
  SemVer v2.0.0 may not be reflected in the official version numbers of the project.
