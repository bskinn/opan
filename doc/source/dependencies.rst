.. List of opan dependencies and known-good versions

opan Dependencies
=================

opan depends on the following Python libraries:

 * numpy
 * scipy
 * h5py

Currently, only the functions to drive the `ORCA <http://orcaforum.cec.mpg.de>`_ package and parse its output files have been implemented.  The opan framework is being designed to accommodate extensibility to other computational packages to the extent possible, though.  Proper installation/configuration of ORCA and construction of suitable input templates and execution scripts is entirely the responsibility of the user. **It is the responsibility of the user to ascertain whether usage of ORCA in concert with opan is in accord with the license conditions of the ORCA package!**
