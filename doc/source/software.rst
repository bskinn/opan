`ORCA <http://orcaforum.cec.mpg.de>`_

    The program ORCA is a modern electronic structure program package written by F. Neese, with contributions
    from many current and former coworkers and several collaborating groups.  ... ORCA is a flexible, efficient
    and easy-to-use general purpose tool for quantum chemistry with specific emphasis on spectroscopic properties
    of open-shell molecules. It features a wide variety of standard quantum chemical methods ranging from
    semiempirical methods to DFT to single- and multireference correlated ab initio methods. It can also treat
    environmental and relativistic effects.
