.. Software packages with opan implementations


Supported Software Packages
==============================

At this development stage, Open Anharmonic is being built with
support only for ORCA.
Pending community response, support for other packages may be added.
In anticipation of such interest, the Open Anharmonic framework is
being designed to facilitate extensibility to other computational
packages to the extent possible.

Proper installation/configuration of external software packages and
construction of suitable input templates, execution scripts, etc. are entirely
the responsibility of the user. **It is the responsibility of the
user to ascertain whether usage of these software packages in concert
with Open Anharmonic is in accord with their respective licenses!!**

Descriptions are quoted from the respective software websites.

`ORCA <http://orcaforum.cec.mpg.de>`_

    The program ORCA is a modern electronic structure program package written by F. Neese, with contributions
    from many current and former coworkers and several collaborating groups.  ... ORCA is a flexible, efficient
    and easy-to-use general purpose tool for quantum chemistry with specific emphasis on spectroscopic properties
    of open-shell molecules. It features a wide variety of standard quantum chemical methods ranging from
    semiempirical methods to DFT to single- and multireference correlated ab initio methods. It can also treat
    environmental and relativistic effects.
