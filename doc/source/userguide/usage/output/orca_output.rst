==========

Preliminary support for |orca| output parsing is provided in
:class:`output.OrcaOutput <opan.output.OrcaOutput>`.


Only works for sure on HF, LDA-DFT, GGA-DFT, mGGA-DFT (conventional

List the available data, categorized, with examples.

Completion indicators (probably one of these will become a
